routes are used so that the app.js doesnt get crowded
they are more like used as middleware (hence they are accessed using 'use')


controllers are more like functions, they are used so that routes dont get crowded


you can set global variables in postman to quickly type


// mongo_db mongoose

db / connect.js
    -> used to connect mongoose with mongo_db

models / Task.js
    -> create schema & models (constructors of the schema)
        model created with two arguments.
    
    to create/add document(instance of the model) to the database
model_name.create({"name": "you can hardcode this way too"})


the model name must start with a captial (uppercase alphabet)

when more info is passed in the post request or so,
only the properties that are present in the schema are taken,
the rest are ignored


to set validation in the schema,
make it as an object
